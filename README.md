What this program does:
========================================

This Python script is based on an old Computational Physics project, in which Poisson's and Laplace's equations are solved for:
- An Electric Monopole.
- An Electric Dipole.

The electric fields of the aforementioned are then visualised in 3D with matplotlib.

Data Visualisations:
========================================

Please see all .png files attached for example output.

Python libraries used:
========================================

This program originally ran in Python 3.7, with the following packages installed:

- numpy
- scipy
